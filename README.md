# Using Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning in D365 to predict Win/Loss of opportunity

Welcome to the BA-SA-ST204 wiki! This page will show you all the steps that are required to complete the lab. Let's get started. 

Here are the steps you need to follow for this lab:

1. [Dynamics 365 CE Customization](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/1.-Dynamics-365-CE-Customization)
2. [Text Analytics service creation in Azure.](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/2.-Text-Analytics-service-creation-in-Azure.)
3. [Logic App creation in Azure, to calculate Text Sentiment Analytics of fields on Opportunity Entity and related notes, and update the same back in Dynamics 365 CE.](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/3.-Logic-App-creation-in-Azure,-to-calculate-Text-Sentiment-Analytics-of-fields-on-Opportunity-Entity-and-related-notes,-and-update-the-same-back-in-Dynamics-365-CE.)
4. [Azure Machine Learning Studio Workspace creation in Azure.](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/4.-Azure-Machine-Learning-Studio-Workspace-creation-in-Azure.)
5. [Machine Learning Experiment creation in Azure ML Studio and train it using sample data](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/5.-Machine-Learning-Experiment-creation-in-Azure-ML-Studio-and-train-it-using-sample-data)
6. [Convert the predictive machine learning experiment to Web Service, Deploy and test the same.](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/6.-Convert-the-predictive-machine-learning-experiment-to-Web-Service,-Deploy-and-test-the-same.)
7. [Creating final Logic App that will run weekly for all Open Opportunities and update their prediction back in Dynamics 365 CE.](https://github.com/crazyLearning/BA-SA-ST204/wiki/7.-Creating-final-Logic-App-that-will-run-weekly-for-all-Open-Opportunities-and-update-their-prediction-back-in-Dynamics-365-CE.)
